# Summary

MiraPy is a Python package[astropy:2018] for Deep Learning in Astronomy. It is built using
Keras [@chollet2015keras] for developing ML models to run on CPU and GPU seamlessly. The
aim is to make applying machine learning techniques on astronomical data easy
for astronomers, researchers and students.

MiraPy can be used for problem solving using ML techniques and will continue to grow to tackle new problems in Astronomy. 

# Applications

Following are the experiments that you can perform right now:

- Classification of X-Ray Binaries using neural network [@Gopalan_2015]
- Astronomical Image Reconstruction using Autoencoder
- Classification of the first catalog of variable stars by ATLAS [@Heinze_2018]
- HTRU1 Pulsar Dataset Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network [@10.1093/mnras/stu1188]
- OGLE Catalogue Variable Star Classification using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) [@1810.09489]
- 2D and 3D visualization of feature sets using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [@Barnes_2016]
- Curve Fitting using Autograd (basic implementation)
